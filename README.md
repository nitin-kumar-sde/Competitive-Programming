# 🏆 Competitive Programming Solutions

Welcome to my repository for competitive programming! Here, I solve problems from various platforms like Spoj, LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerEarth and others. This repo is a collection of solutions to algorithmic challenges, focusing on efficiency, clarity, and creativity.


## 💡 My Approach

When solving problems, I try to follow a systematic approach:

1. **🧐 Understand the Problem**: Carefully analyse the problem and understand the constraints.
2. **🧠 Plan**: Think of different ways to approach the problem (brute force vs optimized)
3. **💻 Code**: Write the solution in a clean and concise manner.
4. **🚀 Optimize**: Try to improve the solution’s time and space complexity.
5. **🧪 Test**: Validate the solution with edge cases and large inputs.
